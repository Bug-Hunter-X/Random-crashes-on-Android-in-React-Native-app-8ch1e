# Random Android Crashes in React Native App

This repository demonstrates a bug causing intermittent crashes on Android devices in a React Native application. The crashes are difficult to reproduce consistently and provide minimal information in the logcat.

## Problem
The app experiences random crashes on Android.  The logcat provides insufficient details for debugging. The app uses React Navigation and multiple third-party libraries, which may be the source of the issue.

## Solution
The solution involves thoroughly checking for native module conflicts, ensuring proper handling of asynchronous operations, and implementing robust error handling throughout the application.  Additional logging may be necessary to help isolate the problem.  This improved error handling makes the cause of any potential issues much easier to debug.  Consider using a crash reporting service like Firebase Crashlytics to monitor and analyze crashes in production.
